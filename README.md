# Harmony

Harmony - https://harmony.roeb.uk/ - is a collabrative real-time music (read â€“ noise) maker. Simply
tap anywhere on the screen to generate a random sound that will play to anyone that's connected.
It's pretty basic as it was thrown together in around 3 hours for Lincoln Hack 16.

It's only been tested in Chrome and Mobile Safari. Don't expect much action in any browser that
doesn't support ES2015 features.
